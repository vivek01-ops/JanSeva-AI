Both are online platforms accessible through a web browser.\n\n**For Diksha:**\n\n1. **Visit the Diksha portal:** Go to the official Diksha website (the exact URL may vary by region; a web search for \"Diksha portal\" will usually provide the correct link).\n2. **Register/Login:** You'll need to create an account if you're a first-time user.  This usually involves providing basic details like your name, email address, and mobile number.  If you already have an account, log in using your credentials.\n3. **Browse and Enroll:** Once logged in, you can browse the available courses, filter by subject, level, and other criteria.  Select the course you wish to pursue and enroll.\n\n\n**For SWAYAM:**\n\n1. **Visit the SWAYAM portal:** Go to the official SWAYAM website (again, a web search for \"SWAYAM portal\" should lead you to the correct link).\n2. **Register/Login:** Similar to Diksha, create an account or log in if you already have one.  You may need to provide details like your name, email address, mobile number, and potentially educational qualifications.\n3. **Browse and Enroll:**  Browse the available courses and enroll in the ones that interest you.  SWAYAM often has different course formats (e.g., Massive Open Online Courses - MOOCs) and may involve different enrollment procedures depending on the course.  Look for clear instructions on the course page.\n\n\n**Important Note:**  While both platforms are generally free to access, some courses may require payment for certification or specific resources.  Check the course details carefully before enrolling.  If you face any difficulties during the registration or enrollment process, look for help links or contact the respective platform's support team.\n"
